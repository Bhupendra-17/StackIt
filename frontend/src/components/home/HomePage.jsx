            "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. For example, useState is used to add state to functional components. You can use it like this: 'const [count, setCount] = useState(0)'. This gives you a state variable 'count' and a function 'setCount' to update it. Other common hooks include useEffect for side effects, useContext for context API, and useReducer for more complex state logic.",

            "JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In web applications, JWTs are commonly used for authentication. After a user logs in with their credentials, the server generates a JWT that contains user information (claims) and sends it back to the client. The client then includes this token in subsequent requests, typically in the Authorization header. The server verifies the token's signature to ensure it hasn't been tampered with before granting access to protected resources. In a MERN stack, you'd typically use libraries like jsonwebtoken on the Node.js backend and store the token in localStorage or cookies on the React frontend.",
